# decimal.h

Teaching team project. Implemented in a team of five people.

In this project we implemented the s21_decimal.h library in the C programming language. This library should add the ability to work with the "decimal" type, which is not in the language standard. Nevertheless, this type is critically important. For financial calculations, for example, where errors of calculations characteristic of types with floating point are unacceptable. As part of the project we worked with the tasks of processing financial information, dive into the issues of internal representation of different types of data, and solidify knowledge of structured programming.
